== Sellers : Community Application

- The application_controller method :smart_layout returns the layout. By default this returns 'application' and the standard views/layouts/application.html.erb file is used. This method should be set to check the domain and set the layout accordingly. (E.g. http://talk.moonzoo.org should set layout to 'moonzoo' and potentially switch the app database also.)

- With layout 'moonzoo', views/layouts/moonzoo.html.erb is used. This has it's own stylesheet includes. 

- Any new sellers site should have it's own application layout, style sheets, image directory and javascript includes. 

- The base communicator.css stylesheet is required, this sets out the basic layouts and styles.

- A new site-specific stylesheet should be included to override base styles, if required. For example these are the included stylesheets:

	communicator.css - base styles required 
	ie.css - IE6/7/8 base style fixes
	generic.css - vanilla styles
	moonzoo.css - moonzoo styles (header and background)
	
- Site-specific images should be stored under public/images/<project_name/. For example moonzoo header images are stored in public/images/moonzoo/header
